# Kanban vs Scrum: Which is Right for Your Team?

Choosing between Kanban and Scrum can be confusing. Both are popular agile methodologies, but they work very differently. Let's break down both approaches to help you make the right choice.

## What is Kanban?

Kanban is a visual workflow management method that emphasizes continuous flow and flexibility.

### Core Principles

1. **Visualize your workflow** - Make all work visible
2. **Limit work in progress** - Prevent bottlenecks
3. **Manage flow** - Optimize the process
4. **Make policies explicit** - Clear rules for everyone
5. **Implement feedback loops** - Regular reviews
6. **Improve collaboratively** - Evolve together

### Key Characteristics

- **Continuous flow**: Work moves through stages continuously
- **WIP limits**: Limit work in progress to prevent overload
- **Flexibility**: Change priorities anytime
- **Visual management**: See everything at a glance
- **No fixed roles**: Team organizes itself

## What is Scrum?

Scrum is an iterative framework with fixed-length sprints and defined ceremonies.

### Core Components

**Roles:**
- Product Owner: Defines what to build
- Scrum Master: Facilitates the process
- Development Team: Builds the product

**Ceremonies:**
- Sprint Planning: Plan the upcoming sprint
- Daily Standup: 15-minute daily sync
- Sprint Review: Demo completed work
- Retrospective: Reflect and improve

**Artifacts:**
- Product Backlog: All work items
- Sprint Backlog: Work for current sprint
- Increment: Completed work

### Scrum Framework

```
Sprint Cycle (2-4 weeks):

Planning → Daily Standups → Review → Retrospective
    ↓                              ↑
Sprint Backlog ──────────────────┘
```

## Key Differences

| Aspect | Kanban | Scrum |
|--------|--------|-------|
| **Cadence** | Continuous flow | Fixed sprints (2-4 weeks) |
| **Roles** | No required roles | Product Owner, Scrum Master, Team |
| **Changes** | Anytime | Only between sprints |
| **Metrics** | Lead time, cycle time | Velocity, burndown |
| **Meetings** | As needed | Fixed ceremonies |
| **Commitment** | Flexible | Sprint goal commitment |
| **Best for** | Support, maintenance | Product development |
| **Learning curve** | Easier | Steeper |

## When to Use Kanban

Choose Kanban if your team:

✅ Has continuous incoming work (support, operations)  
✅ Needs to respond to changing priorities quickly  
✅ Wants maximum flexibility  
✅ Is small or distributed  
✅ Handles maintenance or operational work  
✅ Has unpredictable workload  

### Perfect for These Teams

- **Customer support teams** - Tickets come in continuously
- **DevOps teams** - Responding to incidents and requests
- **Maintenance teams** - Ongoing bug fixes and updates
- **Marketing teams** - Campaign work with shifting priorities

### Kanban Example

```
Support Board:
┌─────────┬──────────┬────────┬──────┐
│ Backlog │ To Do    │ Doing  │ Done │
│         │ (WIP: 5) │ (WIP:3)│      │
├─────────┼──────────┼────────┼──────┤
│ 15 items│ 5 items  │ 3 items│ 12   │
└─────────┴──────────┴────────┴──────┘
```

## When to Use Scrum

Choose Scrum if your team:

✅ Is building a product with clear goals  
✅ Can plan work in advance  
✅ Benefits from structured ceremonies  
✅ Needs clear sprint goals  
✅ Has a dedicated, co-located team  
✅ Works on complex projects  

### Perfect for These Teams

- **Software development teams** - Building new features
- **Product teams** - Iterating on a product
- **Startups** - Moving fast with clear goals
- **Innovation teams** - Experimenting and learning

### Scrum Example

```
Sprint 1 (2 weeks):
Day 1: Planning (8 story points)
Day 2-9: Daily standups + Development
Day 10: Review + Retrospective

Sprint 2 starts immediately
```

## Can You Use Both? Enter Scrumban

Yes! Many teams use **Scrumban** - a hybrid approach that combines the best of both:

### Scrumban Benefits

- Use Scrum's **ceremonies and roles** for structure
- Apply Kanban's **visual board and WIP limits** for flow
- Get **flexibility** of Kanban with **predictability** of Scrum
- **Easier transition** from Scrum to Kanban (or vice versa)

### When to Use Scrumban

- Transitioning between methodologies
- Need structure but also flexibility
- Mature Scrum teams wanting more flow
- Teams with mixed work types

## Getting Started

### Starting with Kanban

1. **Map your current workflow** - Document how work flows today
2. **Create a visual board** - Make work visible
3. **Set WIP limits** - Start with current capacity
4. **Measure and improve** - Track cycle time and optimize

### Starting with Scrum

1. **Define roles** - Assign Product Owner and Scrum Master
2. **Create product backlog** - List all work items
3. **Plan first sprint** - Select items for 2-week sprint
4. **Hold daily standups** - 15 minutes every morning
5. **Review and retrospect** - Learn and improve

## Making the Decision

Consider these factors:

### Team Factors

- **Size**: Small teams (< 5) → Kanban, Larger teams → Scrum
- **Location**: Distributed → Kanban, Co-located → Either
- **Experience**: New to agile → Kanban, Experienced → Either

### Work Factors

- **Type**: Continuous → Kanban, Project-based → Scrum
- **Predictability**: Unpredictable → Kanban, Predictable → Scrum
- **Urgency**: High urgency → Kanban, Planned → Scrum

### Organization Factors

- **Culture**: Flexible → Kanban, Structured → Scrum
- **Stakeholders**: Need frequent demos → Scrum, Continuous delivery → Kanban

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Kanban Mistakes

❌ No WIP limits (defeats the purpose)  
❌ Not measuring flow metrics  
❌ Ignoring blockers  
❌ No regular improvement  

### Scrum Mistakes

❌ Skipping retrospectives  
❌ Changing sprint scope mid-sprint  
❌ No clear definition of done  
❌ Scrum Master as project manager  

## Conclusion

There's no "one size fits all" answer. The best methodology depends on:

- Your team's nature and size
- Type of work you do
- Organizational culture
- Need for flexibility vs structure

**Pro tip**: Start with one, experiment for 3 months, and adjust. Both methodologies encourage continuous improvement, so you can always evolve your approach.
