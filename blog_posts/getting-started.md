# Getting Started with Taskify

Welcome to Taskify! This comprehensive guide will help you get started with our powerful project management platform and have you managing projects like a pro in no time.

## Why Taskify?

Taskify brings your tasks, team, and tools together in one place. Whether you're managing a small team or coordinating across multiple departments, Taskify provides the flexibility and power you need.

## Creating Your First Workspace

A workspace is where all your boards and projects live. Here's how to create one:

1. **Sign up** for a Taskify account
2. Click on **"Add Workspace"** from your dashboard
3. Give your workspace a meaningful name (e.g., "Marketing Team", "Product Development")
4. Start adding team members!

## Setting Up Your First Board

Boards help you organize tasks visually using the Kanban methodology. To create a board:

1. Navigate to your workspace
2. Click **"Create Board"**
3. Name your board (e.g., "Website Redesign", "Q4 Campaign")
4. Add a description to help team members understand the board's purpose

### Board Structure Example

```
Board: "Website Redesign"
â”œâ”€â”€ Backlog
â”œâ”€â”€ To Do
â”œâ”€â”€ In Progress
â”œâ”€â”€ Review
â””â”€â”€ Done
```

## Best Practices

### Keep it Simple
Start with basic columns like "To Do", "In Progress", and "Done". You can always add more complexity later as your team grows.

### Use Labels and Tags
Color-code your tasks for better visibility. Common labels include:
- **Priority**: High, Medium, Low
- **Type**: Bug, Feature, Enhancement
- **Status**: Blocked, Waiting, Ready

### Set Deadlines
Keep your team accountable by setting realistic deadlines for each task. Taskify will send reminders to ensure nothing falls through the cracks.

### Regular Updates
Make it a habit to update your boards daily. A quick 5-minute review can save hours of confusion later.

## Inviting Team Members

Collaboration is key! Here's how to invite your team:

1. Open your workspace
2. Click on the **"Members"** tab
3. Enter email addresses
4. Set permissions:
   - **Admin**: Full control
   - **Member**: Can create and edit
   - **Viewer**: Read-only access
